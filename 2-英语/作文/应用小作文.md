## Suggestion

### For librarian(2007)
![[应用小作文-2007.png]]

原文：

As a senior who is preparing for the postgraduate examination in the library, I am very grateful to enjoy studying in such a clean and tidy environment, where your hard work is indispensable. However, there is still something that can be improved. ​
Here are some suggestions to better our students' learning environment and co-maintain a beautiful library. First and foremost, there is a great risk of getting influenza in such a closed and stagnant environment. Thus, I hope you can do some disinfection work every day after the library closed. In addition, due to a great quantity of students, there is a large demand for drinking water. We would appreciate it if you could set up several water-providing facilities. Last but not least, in order to communicate with students more conveniently, you can establish a platform to publish announcements and receive comments, such as WeChat chat room. ​
Hopefully my suggestions will be accepted and thank you for your hard work again.

![[应用小作文-2011-1.png]]

Dear Bob,

​Knowing that you are faced with a "film shortage", I’m writing to introduce an excellent film, *The Wandering Earth II*, which stars in Wu Jing, Liu Dehua, Li Xuejian, etc. and enjoys a high reputation among overwhelming majority of the Chinese fans of science fiction movies.
​	As a prequel to the 2019 blockbuster science fiction film *The Wandering Earth*, the new one imagines a virtual disaster - in future the Sun rapidly expands into a red giant and will engulf the Earth in 100 years, different choices made by people to deal with such catastrophe. A small number of people hope to upload mentality to computers and become digital life so as to escape from reality. While the Chinese government appeal to build thousands of giant planetary engines to drive the Earth to escape together and travel to distant habitable galaxies, which is named The Move Mountain Project. In this movie, you will see thrilling air combat scenes, cool robots, touching father-daughter relationships, the ethical paradox between artificial intelligence and humanity, the great spirit of the global masses who are desperate to save humanity, and so on. Believe me, this three hours viewing feast will definitely satisfy all your imagination about hardcore science fiction movie.

### For a inquiry and specify the details(2019.1)
![[应用小作文-2019-1.png]]
Dear Bob,

​	I am quite delighted to receive your inquiry about the “ Aiding Rural Primary Schools” project of our university. Now, let me write to specify its relevant details.
​	First of all, this project is organized for the purpose of giving more children in mountainous areas the opportunity to receive preliminary education. With the foundation of literacy and spelling, children will have the opportunity to further read and learn, go out of the mountains and integrate into the society. Meanwhile, this project moderated the unbalanced distribution of educational resources to a certain extent, and mobilized college students to participate in social practice and understand the current situation of the unbalanced development of society, so that they have a further comprehension of self-awareness and promote them to participate in social construction. Finally, education is the light to break the darkness of ignorant, and this project is the light source.
​	Hope my description will help you to have a better comprehension of this project, and hope you will also participate in. Looking forward to your early reply.

Yours sincerely,

## Consultation

### Ask for help about living abroad.(2014.2)
![[应用小作文-2014-2.png]]
Dear John,

​	Through querying the dormitory manual, I learn that we will become roommates who spend postgraduate study life together at Princeton University. First of all, I would like to introduce myself — a student from the Computer Department of Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.
​	In terms of the majority of living habits, I am easy-going and believe in the traditional Chinese thought that peace is most precious. Nothing cannot be solved through communication. However, due to my personal health problems, I hope that our dormitory is a civilized environment that is free of tobacco and alcohol. In addition, developing regular life schedules, such as getting up early and doing exercise routinely, are more conducive to completing academic tasks. As a student who has never arrived in the United States, I also want to ask you for some suggestions on daily life about shopping, transportation climate and customs there. I will be extremely grateful if you are so warm-hearted to give me any suggestions.
​	Finally, I hope we will spend an unforgettable learning time together and looking forward to the reply at your early convenience.

Yours sincerely,
Zhang Wei
