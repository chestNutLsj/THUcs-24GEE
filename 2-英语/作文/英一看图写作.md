### 2003. Independence

![[英一看图写作-2003.png]]

- 家长过度的关注/保护，忽视了年轻人独立的重要性：
> Parents pay excessive attention/protection to youngster’s comfort and enjoyment, with ignoring the significance of independence for the young.

- 溺爱：
> spoil sb
> be indulgent to sb

- 花朵绽放：
> The flowers are blossoming and growing vigorously.

- 枯萎：
> wither

- 花瓣：
> petal(s)

- 正是家长的过度保护，造成了年轻人竞争力和自信心不足以应对社会挑战：
> It is parents’ overprotection that causes young people to build up inadequate competence or confidence to face the society.

- 家长的过分关爱，就像温室一样，对他们的孩子的成长构成了障碍
> Unfortunately, some parents’ too much love, like the greenhouse, has constituted an obstacle that hinders their children’s growth.

> [!note] Writing.
> As an enlightening Chinese saying goes, "One thrives and survives under suffering and hardships, and withers if left overly-protected and contented with the current situation." In the first picture of the above cartoons, there is a flower blossoming/in full bloom and growing vigorously in a greenhouse, but as illustrated in the second picture, when the flower is out of its shelter and beaten in the rain, its petals wither and drift down. Below the drawing, there is an indication which says,"the flower growing in the greenhouse isn't capable of standing the rain and wind."
> > 👍: The wisdom of an ancient Chinese adage resonates: "One thrives and survives under suffering and hardships, and withers if left overly-protected and contented with the current situation." In the initial cartoon panel, a vibrant flower blooms within the confines of a greenhouse. Yet, the subsequent image portrays the same flower wilting in the rain outside the shelter. The accompanying caption reads,"The sheltered flower succumbs to the elements."
> 
> Apparently, the drawing symbolically reveals a social phenomenon common to our daily lives: the excessive love of some parents, like the greenhouse, has unfortunately constituted an obstacle to hinder the growth of their children. Admittedly, it is true that youngsters cannot grow up without the nurture and protection of their parents. Yet, if parents set too much indulgent love for their children, they will not have sufficient spirit of competition and perseverance to accomplish a glorious career. In this sense, letting teenagers experience the storms of life is a better way to develop/cultivate their capabilities and mental strength.
> > 👍: This symbolic narrative mirrors a prevalent societal dynamic: excessive parental protection, akin to the greenhouse, impedes a child's development. Undoubtedly, parental guidance is crucial for a child's growth. However, an overabundance of coddling can stifle their drive and resilience needed for future endeavors. Allowing youths to confront life's challenges nurtures their adaptability and fortitude.
> 
> In conclusion, parental protection can prove to be a double-edged sword. We should, therefore, take advantage of the fruits and avoid the opposite facet - as parents, provide the necessary assistance and avoid over-protecting. With this consciousness rising, it is reasonable for us to believe that the problem of the lack of independence in some adolescents will be addressed.
> > 👍: In essence, parental care can be a double-edged sword. Striking a balance between support and exposure to life's trials is pivotal. By providing necessary guidance without excessive sheltering, parents empower their children to navigate the complexities of life. This awareness fosters independence and self-reliance in adolescents.

### 2007. Self-Confidence

![[英一看图写作-2007.png]]

- 首段：上图是一幅有趣但深刻的漫画，其中展现了在足球场右侧男子即将射门，而左侧男子正在防守的画面。尽管两人的身材大小客观上一致，但右侧男子却感觉守门员身躯大得要把门框都遮住，而左侧男子却感觉自己如此渺小以致于防守任务难以实现。这两人都犯了错误——一个过于高估对手水平，一个过于低估自己能力，两人都不够客观和自信。

> **Evidently, the cartoon above looks ridiculous at first sight/glance but on second thought it is enlightening.** On a football playground, the guy on the right side is about to shoot at the goal, while the man on the left is defending. Although the two men **are objectively the same size**, the right-hand man feels that the **goalkeeper**'s body is so large that it nearly **covers the entire goal**, while the left-hand man feels that he is so small that guarding the goal becomes an impossible mission. Both ~~of them~~ make mistakes—one **overestimates** the level of his opponent, the other **underestimates** his own ability, and neither ~~of them~~ is objective and self-confident enough.

- 正文：上图这样的画面可以与现实中一系列面对困难和挑战的反应联系起来。必须要承认的是，在面对困难时，正确地评估自身的能力和困难的难度、并且充满战胜困难的自信是一种可贵的品质。正是这样的品质才能使得我们充分发挥自身优势、战胜困难。一个现实的例子正是我自己。在备战考研的过程中，如果将通过考试视为不可战胜的目标，那我将永远无法成功，只有充满自信、充分发挥自己长处，最终才有机会成功。

> Such a scene above can be associated with/related to a series/range of situations that present difficulties and challenges in reality. Admittedly, **in the face of seemingly invincible difficulties**, **possessing self-confidence** and evaluating your own capabilities are the utmost/ultimate qualities. It is qualities such as these that enable us to **provoke our strengths and overcome our difficulties**. A case in point is me. In ~~the process of~~ preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination, if I had considered passing the exam as an unlikely goal, I would never have accomplished it. **Only by being filled with self-confidence and bringing my strengths into full play can I finally have a chance to succeed/at success.**

- 结尾：总之，正如名言“世上无难事，只怕有心人”。正确评估自身能力，充满自信不断奋斗，才是我们大学生在学习中和步入社会后的行动指南。

> In a nutshell, as the saying goes, “**nothing is impossible to a willing heart**”. **Tricks, assessments of one's own abilities, building confidence and constant struggle are precious guides to how** our college students should behave during their studies and after graduation.

> [!note] improved version.
> At first glance, the depicted cartoon appears whimsical, yet upon deeper contemplation, it emerges as thought-provoking. In a football arena, the figure on the right prepares to take a shot at the goal, while the opposing defender stands on the left. Despite their equivalent stature, the shooter perceives the goalkeeper as colossal, nearly engulfing the entire goalpost, while the defender views himself as diminutive, incapable of defending effectively. Both individuals err -- one by overestimating the opponent's prowess, the other by understanding his own abilities, revealing a lack of objectivity and self-confidence.
> 
> This imagery mirrors numerous real-life scenarios, underscoring the challenges and obstacles one faces. When confronted with seemingly insurmountable difficulties, possessing self-assurance and accurately assessing one's capabilities become paramount. These attributes enable individuals to leverage their strengths and conquer adversities. A parallel can be drawn to my own journey in preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination; considering the goal unattainable would ensure failure. Only by nurturing self-confidence and leveraging my strengths could I envisage the possibility of success.
> 
> To summarize, the adage "nothing is impossible to a willing heart" resonates profoundly. Strategies such as evaluating our capabilities, fostering confidence, and persistently striving are invaluable guides for students, shaping their approach to learning and post-graduation endeavors.

### 2008. Cooperation

![[英一看图写作-2008.png]]

- 首段：上图描述了一则发人深省的关于合作的漫画，在画中有两个腿部残疾的男子，用仅存的腿和有力的胳膊互相搀扶着，继续他们新的旅行，在身后是留下的两副拐。尽管两人都有残疾，但跛脚的障碍已经被成功地克服。在漫画下面的图注解释道：“你一条腿，我一条腿，你我一起，走南闯北”。

> **The figure above depicts** a thought-provoking cartoon about cooperation, in which two men, both of whom are leg-disabled/**handicapped**, supported by **their remaining legs and firm arms**, are embarking on their new journey, with two pairs of **crutches** left behind them. Although they are both handicapped/Despite their handicaps, **the obstacle/barrier of lameness has been successfully cracked**. **The caption at the bottom interprets**: “**You have merely one leg and so do I. Helping each other, we can travel around the world**.”

- 正文：这幅画寓意了现实生活中合作共赢的品质。具体说来，人们在生活为了实现目标，除了提升自己，还可以通过联合其他人。毕竟我们每个人不可能在每件事都能力超群，而在薄弱之处选择和他人合作共赢、扬长避短，更能促进双方的进步。一个典型的例子就是我。在学习中广泛地与他人交流合作，互相解答疑问，更好地促进我们的思维进步和成绩提升。

> This scene **implies/hints at the quality of win-win cooperation in reality**. To be more specific, in order to accomplish their missions, people must not only improve themselves, but also cooperate with others. After all, it is impossible for each of us to **excel in everything**, and **it is more conducive to progress on both sides to cooperate with others in the weak areas to achieve win-win results and avoid weakness**. A case in point is me. In learning, I always/constantly communicate and collaborate extensively with others, answering each other's questions and better promoting/facilitating our thought progress and achievements.

- 结尾：每个人都应牢记于心：个人的力量是有限的，团结他人共同努力的力量则是无限的。因此，我们应该广泛地与他人合作，慷慨地贡献力量，才能更好地促进个人和集体的发展。

> It should be borne in mind that **there is a limit to the strength of the individual, and no limit to the strength with which others may be united in one effort**. Therefore, we should cooperate widely with others and contribute generously to better promote individual and collective development.

> [!note] improved version
> The depicted cartoon presents a stirring tableau on cooperation, portraying two leg-handicapped men embarking on a transformative journey. Both individuals, equipped with resolute and their remaining leg, step forward, leaving behind their crutches. Despite their physical challenges, they stride forward, breaking the barrier of their lameness. The caption beneath reads,"You have merely one leg, and so do I. Helping each other, we can travel around the world."
> This poignant scene subtly unveils the essence of symbiotic cooperation in reality. Specifically, in the pursuit of our endeavors, personal advancement necessitates collaboration with others. Acknowledging that mastery in every domain is unattainable, it becomes advantageous to engage in reciprocal assistance, leveraging collective strengths to mitigate individual weakness. Personally, I actively engage in extensive collaborative learning, fostering an environment where questions are exchanged, nurturing the collective progress and intellectual enrichment of all involved.
> It is imperative to acknowledge the limitations of individual prowess, yet realize the boundless potential when united in a collective endeavor. Thus, a broad collaboration with a generous contribution becomes the linchpin for both individual and collective progress, fostering development on multifaceted levels. As the proverb wisely encapsulates: "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

> Confucianism, also known as Ruism or Ru classicism, is a system of thought and behavior originating in ancient China, and is variously decribed as a tradition, philosophy, religion, theory of government, or way of life.
> 
> 诸子百家：Hundred Schools of Thought

> 
> Confucianism regards texts such as the *Five Classics* as examples that should be followed to increase the harmony of the family, social order as a whole, and the world.
> 
> 人文主义：Humanistic
> With particular emphasis on the importance of the family and social harmony, rather than on an otherworldly souce of spiritual values, the core of Confucianism is humanistic.

> 
> 新文化运动：New Culture Movement
> 学说、教义：doctrine
> 三民主义：Three Principles of the People
> 毛泽东思想：Maoism
> The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weakness. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the "Three Principles of the People" with the establishment of the Republic of China, and then Maoism under the People's Republic of China.

> As the enlightening wisdom of the well-known writer, Lu Xun, reads, "Only the nation's culture will be the world's." Similarly, a considerably/rather comprehensive cartoon hotpot on the cultures of the worldwide peoples, as depicted by the figure above, causes me to reflect deeply. There are many elements/ingredients in the hotpot, such as Peking Opera, a traditional Chinese dramatic art; Swan Lake, a Russian classical ballet; Kung fu, a Chinese martial art; Butterfly Lovers, a touching Chinese love tale, etc. The subtitle indicates: cultural hotpot is delicious and nutritious.
> 
> The metaphorical and impressive picture subtly reveals the integration and prevalence of the cultures of the worldwide peoples. With the rapid development of the world and the times, cultural exchanges and integration have become an irreversible and inevitable trend. Although it must be admitted/acknowledged that some ancient cultures or customs will be gradually phased out/eliminated and forgotten as a result of the integration of cultures, on the whole, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. In the process of cultural exchanges and fusion, each civilization complements its own strengths and weaknesses, and at the same time deepens its exchanges and communication with other peoples of the world, thus giving a strong impetus for the initiative of "The Community of Common Destiny". Traditional Chinese culture, such as Confucianism and Peking Opera, will also radiate modern vitality with cultural exchanges.
> 
> Therefore, as a Chinese in the 21st century era of great world exchanges, I am very much looking forward to cultural exchanges and integration, and to seeing traditional Chinese culture being newly interpreted and developed in this process. As individuals, we should also make a conscious effort to integrate traditional cultural knowledge and other national and modern cultures while learning about them in a broad way. In this way, the world will become more tolerant and pluralistic.

> 随着世界和时代的高速发展，文化交流和融合已成为不可逆转的必然趋势，虽然不得不承认，部分古老的文化或习俗会随着文化融合逐渐淘汰，被人遗忘，但总体来说利远大于弊。在文化交流与融合之中，各个文明取长补短，精进自身内涵的同时，又与世界其他民族加深了交流与沟通，为“人类命运共同体”这一倡议作出有力的推动。中国的传统文化，如儒家学说、京剧戏曲等，也会随着文化的交流而焕发出现代化的生命力。
> 
> 因此，作为 21 世纪世界大交流时代的中国人，我非常期待文化的交流与融合，并且看到中国的传统文化在这个进程中得到新的诠释和发展。作为个人，我们在广泛学习传统文化知识和其它民族文化、现代文化的同时，也要有意识地促进它们的融合。如此，世界会更加包容、多元。

> [!note] improved version
> As renowned writer Lu Xun profoundly stated,"A nation's culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people." This resonates deeply as I contemplate the intricate tapestry depicted in the image above, a diverse and elaborate metaphorical hotpot of golbal cultures. Each ingredient, from the venerable Peking Opera to the captivating Swan Lake, from the prowess of Kung Fu to the poignant narrative of the Butterfly Lovers, represents a distinct facet of humanity's cultural heritage. This cultural amalgamation serves as a testament to the rich tapestry woven by civilizations across the globe, offering not just a feast for the palate but a feast for the mind and soul.
> 
> The imagery subtly unveils the profound convergence and prevalence of global cultures. In an era marked by rapid globalization, the amalgamation and diffusion of cultures have become an inexorable and transformative force. While it's undeniable that the amalgamation my erode certain ancient customs, the overarching benefits far outweigh such losses. In this symphony of cultural exchange, civilizations not only fortify their inherent strengths but also forge profound connections, fostering a spirit of mutual understanding-a cornerstone for a collective human destiny.
> 
> Amidst the global discourse, the enduring tenets of traditional Chinese cultures, like the philosophies of Confucianism and the artistic allure of Peking Opera, find themselves revitalized through this exchange, breathing new life into their timeless wisdom.
> 
> As denizens of the 21st century, we stand at the cusp of an epochal intermingling of cultures. Embracing this era of cultural convergence, I eagerly anticipate the renaissance of traditional Chinese heritage in this expansive interplay. Embracing a conscientious approach, we, as individuals, should actively synthesize traditional wisdom with the kaleidoscope of global cultures. In this unification, the world will blossom into a cradle of tolerance and pluralism, a testament to humanity's collective growth.

### 2011. Environment protect

![[英一看图写作-2011.png]]

> As the consensus on the concept of ecological civilization governance stated by the president of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, says, "Clear waters and green mountains are as valuable as gold and silver mountains." But the image above, in which two tourists on a boat gawk at the river scenery but casually drop garbage along the way, is the exact opposite, and shows that some people still lack environmental awareness. Below the drawing, there is a caption which indicates,"Remainders after the trip."
> 
> Without a doubt, we can deduce/infer from the picture that the cartoonist is trying to attract/draw our attention to the issue of the polluted environment due to the inappropriate behavior of tourists. Actually, the natural environment is the foundation/basis of human production and life, and in this sense, polluting the environment is harming humanity itself. A case in point is the tree-planting and afforestation movement on the Loess Plateau, which has been going on for nearly 70 years and will continue to persist/do so. In the past, severe environmental problems such as sandstorms and soil erosion often occurred/were frequent here, but after 70 years and three generations of unremitting efforts, the environment on the Loess Plateau has been greatly improved, and the yellow earth has become a green homeland. Had it not been for such a sense of environmental protection and effort, we would have suffered year after year from the invasion/incursions of the harsh environment.
> 
> There is no doubt that human beings are capable of/have the power to transform(ing) nature, but only by persistently protecting the environment can we better coexist harmoniously with nature.

>[!note] improved version
> In accordance with President Xi Jinping's advocacy for ecological civilization governance,"Clear waters and green mountains are as valuable as gold and silver mountains." However, the vivid image presented above portrays a stark contrast. Two tourists leisurely traverse a river, their eyes feasting on the scenic beauty, yet their nonchalant disposal of garbage along the way contradicts this ethos. Beneath the illustration lies a caption: "Remnants after the trip."
> 
> Undoubtedly, the artist seeks to draw our attention to the detrimental impact of tourist misbehavior on the environment. It ememplifies a pervasive lack of environmental consciousness among certain individuals. The natural environment forms the bedrock of human sustenance and progress; thus, despoiling it equates to self-inflicted harm. Consider the commendable tree-planting and afforestation endeavors spanning seven decades on the Loess Plateau. Once ravaged by sandstorms and soil erosion, concerted efforts across three generations have revitalized this terrain. The barren yellow earth has metamorphosed into a verdant sanctuary. Absent such dedication to environmental stewardship, this region would have perennially endured harsh environmental onslaughts.
> 
> While humanity possesses the capacity to manipulate nature, it's only through unwavering environmental preservation that we can coexist harmoniously with our natural habitat. As the ancient proverb goes,"A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in."

### 2012. Optimism&pessimism

![[英一看图写作-2012.png]]

- 首段：上图以鲜明的对比描绘了发人深思的画面。在地上有一个倒下并流出来一半水的水壶，旁边有两人的反映截然不同。左边一人说“全完了”并懊恼地扶着额头，右边一人则说“幸好还剩点”并且立刻伸手去扶起水壶。

> The figure above depicts a thought-provoking cartoon **in sharp/stark contrast**. On the ground was **an over-turned kettle**, with half of water flowing out, and standing by it were two men with distinct reactions. **The left one said "It’s all over" and patted his forehead in frustration, while the right one said “Fortunately, there is still some left” and hurried up to pick up the kettle.** Although it was the same kettle, these two men’s reactions were **totally/completely different**.

- 正文：上述漫画可以与现实生活中的乐观态度与悲观态度以及付出行动结合起来。例如，在面对一件糟糕的事情发生时，乐观的人选择积极面对并加以补救，而悲观的人则只会发出怨天尤人的叹息而无动于衷。这样的现象揭示了不同的心态在面对困境时的不同表现，而事实上这也会导致截然不同的结果。正是由于乐观的态度和积极地补救行为，才能进一步减少危害并寻找到争取的解决方案。
- 对我而言，乐观的态度和积极的行动就想通向成功的一场旅行。作为一个正在备战考研的大四学生，我几乎每天都会遇到困难，但是乐观的心态带给我力量，激发我的热情并且帮助我积极地攻克它们。

> Such a scene above can be associated with **optimism and pessimism attitudes and timely action against adversity in reality**. For instance, in the face of a terrible setback, an optimistic person chooses to confront it head-on and **remedy it in time**, **while a pessimistic person merely complains and does nothing**. This phenomenon **not only reveals the performances/manifestations of different attitudes in the face of difficulties, but also leads to distinctive consequences in fact**. **It is precisely because of the optimistic attitudes and positive remedial actions that we can further reduce the harm and find solutions to fight against the dilemma**. 
> 
> To my understanding, an optimistic attitude and positive action can be likened to a journey that leads to success. A case in point is me. As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduates, I **face diverse challenges on a near-daily basis**. Anyway, **an optimistic mind brings me power, rouses my passion for striving and helps me conquer hardships/to triumph over the odds**.

- 结尾：因此，尽管从不同角度看待事物会得到不同的结论，这是一种客观存在，但我们依然可以尽力使自己保持积极乐观的态度，尽力减少糟糕事情的危害，获得尽可能好的结果。

> Therefore, although **it is objective to view things from different perspectives and reach different conclusions, we can still try to keep an optimistic attitude and do our best to moderate the harm of the terrible things and achieve the best possible results/outcome**.

> [!note] improved version
> The illustration above presents a thought-provoking tableau, sharply constrasting two men's reactions to a spilled half-filled kettle. Upon the ground lies an overturned vessel, its contents partially spilled, prompting distinct responses from the two observers. Positioned to the left, one man exclaims,"It's all over", visibly perturbed as he gestures to his forehead in apparent frustration. Conversely, on the right, the other man swiftly assesses the situation and remarks,"Fortunately, there is still some left," promptly moving to retrieve the kettle. Despite sharing the same circumstance, these two individuals react in starkly different ways.
> 
> This scene resonates deeply with the dichotomy of optimism and pessimism, emphasizing the criticality of proactive responses amidst adversity. When faced with significant setbacks, an optimist confronts challenges head-on, taking timely action to mitigate the situation, while a pessimist often resigns to complaint without initiative. This contrast not only highlights differing attitudes toward difficulty but also yields divergent real-life consequences. Optimistic attitudes coupled with proactive measures serve to minimize harm and uncover viable solutions to combat adversity. To my understanding, an optimistic mindset, coupled with proactive steps, parallels a journey toward success. Consider my circumstancea as I, a senior preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduates, encounter multifaceted challenges regularly. Nevertheless, an optimistic outlook empowers me, igniting the zeal to persist and triumph over adversities.
> 
> Therefore, while objectivity allows for varing perspectives and conclusions, fostering an optimistic attitude and exerting our best efforts remains pivotal in mitigating the impact of adversity and striving for optimal outcomes.
> 
> In support of this sentiment, there exists a Chinese proverb that resonates: "When the wind of change blow, some people build walls, while others build windmills." This adage encapsulates the essence of optimism and proactive adaptation when faced with challenges.

### 2013. After graduation

![[英一看图写作-2013.png]]

> The painting above demonstrates a group of graduates standing at a crossroads of career choices, facing different paths leading to different directions, such as job seeking, preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination, studying abroad, entrepreneuring, etc., hesitating and are unsure of how to choose and where to move forward. Beneath the illustration lies the caption:"Choice". But from my perspective, I will say and encourage them, that is,"All roads lead to Rome."
> 
> It is quite common for students to feel confused about choosing different development paths when approaching to graduation. In the past decade or so, we have followed the guidance of our parents and teachers step-by-step to complete our studies. However, choosing our next development path after graduating from university is the first test of our ability to independently plan our lives as adults. Therefore, when making future plans, we should be aware that different goals require different skills, such as learning ability that helps with postgraduate entrance exams and completing graduate learning tasks, interpersonal communication ability that helps with collaboration in the workplace, independent living ability that is essential for further education abroad, and innovative thinking ability that helps with entrepreneurial success. Thus, considering/(taking into account) our own abilities and making reasonable plans are crucial steps towards success. It is with the perseverance and determination to never give up and to keep moving forward that we can eventually reach Rome - our ideal destination for success.
> 
> All in all/In a word, there is no need to be perplexed, no need to hesitate, to think clearly about our ideals and practical abilities, and to strive for them, which are the best decisions for us graduates to accomplish success.

> [!note] improved version
> The depicted scene portrays a cohort of graduates stationed at the crossroads of their career journey, confronted with diverging paths leading to varied destinations - be it job hunting, preparing for postgraduate entrance examination, pursuing overseas education, venturing into entrepreneurship, and more. They stand in indecision, grappling with the quandary of choice. Etched beneath the illustration reads a succinct yet profound caption: "Choice." In my interpretation, I offer this counsel: "All roads lead to Rome."
> 
> As graduation approaches, it is customary for students to grapple with the labyrinth of diverse career trajectories. For years, our educational pursuits have been guided by the counsel of parents and mentors, shepherding us through academic milestones. However, the juncture post-university is the inaugural test of our autonomy in life planning as burgeoning adults. Hence, as we chart our futures, cognizance must be given to the specific proficiencies requisite for distinct aspirations. These may encompass acumen vital for postgraduate entrance exams and academic endeavors, adeptness in interpersonal dynamics indispensable in the professional realm, self-reliance pivotal for international academia, and the innovative faculty fundamental for entrepreneurial triumph. Ergo, a cogent and success-driven strategy demands a meticulous alignment of our competiencies with our aspirations. It is through resolute perserverance and an unwavering commitment to progress that we traverse our path towards Rome - our paragon of success.
> 
> In summation, confusion and vacillation need not encumber us. Rather, lucidity in delineating our ambitions vis-a-vis our practical proficiencies, coupled with indefatigable pursuit, embodies the quintessence of wise decision-making for us, the graduates, to orchestrate triumph.

### 2014. Kin relationship

![[英一看图写作-2014.png]]

> Time, it has been said, is both the gentlest and the cruelest of things, for it bestows all possibilities upon the future while it erases everything from the past. The best interpretation of this remark is the comic above, in which a mom and a daughter are shown together. In the left-hand picture, illustrating a scene from thirty years ago, the daughter, in her tender and adorable stage, was holding her mother's hand, and, with unsteady steps, exploring the vast world. On the other hand, the right panel depicts the present situation: the mother has aged and become frail, while her daughter, now in the prime of her life, is supporting and protecting her mother. As the caption indicates,"Mutual Support." 
> 
> The passage of time is ruthless, yet the mutual support of family members is compassionate; this comic seeks to convey/deliver such a message. When we are young and vulnerable, it is our parents and their unselfish love that strongly protect us, help us to grow up healthily, and lead us to become strong and capable individuals. Correspondingly, as our parents grow older, we should not hesitate to take care of them, to provide them with the most intimate warmth and effective assistance. This is perhaps best illustrated by the epic story of Hua Mulan, a Chinese girl warrior who disguised herself as a man to take her aged father's place in the military. A large number of stories like this one tell us that caring for elderly parents is not only a traditional Chinese virtue, but our fundamental responsibility as well.
> 
> What we should do, therefore, is to love our family, especially our parents who raised us. Meanwhile, we should widely promote such excellent traditional Chinese virtues and jointly build a beautiful society that respects the elderly and loves children.

> 孝顺：filial piety / filial obedience

>[!note] improved version
> Time, the gentlest yet cruelest force, grants boundless possibilities to the future while obliterating the past. This duality finds its profound reflection in the depicted fable, where a mother and daughter stand as symbols of enduring support. The left panel encapsulates a scene from three decades past: the daughter, tender and endearing, clutches her mother's hand, navigating the world with uncertain steps. Contrastingly, the right panel portrays the present: the mother, weathered by time's passage, appears frail, while her daughter, now in her prime, steadfastly supports and safeguards her. The caption resonates, "Mutual Support."
> 
> Time, relentless in its passage, finds solace in the compassionate embrace of familial support, echoing the poignant narrative of this fable. During our vulnerable youth, it is the selfless devotion of parents that shields, nurtures, and steers us toward strength and independence. As the sands of time weigh on our parents, it becomes our privilege and duty to reciprocate, enveloping them in the warmth of care and offering unwavering aid. The legend of Hua Mulan, who, donning male guise, answered her aging father's call in the military, epitomizes this bond. Such narratives echo a universal truth: tending to our elders isn't solely an ancient Chinese virtue but a fundamental responsibility transcending cultures.

> Our charge remains clear: to cherish our kin, especially those who shaped us. Concurrently, the advocacy of these esteemed virtues, deeply rooted in Chinese tradition, beckons us to collectively fashion a society venerating the elderly and cherishing the young. As an old Chinese proverb reminds, "Filial piety is the root of all virtues." Its wisdom echoes the timeless essence of caring for our elders, laying the foundation for a society brimming with compassion and respect.

### 2015. Absorbed in mobile phone

![[英一看图写作-2015.png]]

> In the era of the Internet, we all have mobile phones for convenient online correspondence, but someone raises a joke: "The farthest distance in the world is not between life and death, but when I stand in front of you, you are staring at the phone." The picture above vividly depicts such a common but ridiculous scene and causes my deep reflection. It shows two gentlemen and two ladies, who appear to be feasting together. However, they are all so engrossed in their phones that they put the chopsticks aside, and none of them try to speak directly to each other. What a horrible dining experience!
> 
> Apparently, the author strives to send out an abundantly clear message that some people are so obsessed with the content of their mobile phones that they lose interest in communicating with others directly, which is of extreme detriment to the interpersonal relationships. Respect and communication between people is mutual. If we immerse ourselves in the virtual world of mobile phones, we gradually lose the opportunity to connect with others and then drift away from the human network, becoming socially isolated individuals.
> 
> Therefore, we should put our mobile phones to the right use - as a handy tool to keep in touch with distant friends, catch up on the news and take in leisurely entertainment. When communicating face-to-face with others, putting down the phone, actively responding to their conversation, and respecting their emotions are the key to maintaining good and healthy interpersonal relationships.

> In today's digital age, the ubiquity of smartphones facilitates seamless online communication. However, a poignant jest resonates: 'The greatest distance is not between life and death, but when I stand before you, and yet you are absorbed in your device.' The depicted image encapsulates this everyday yet absurd scenario, prompting profound contemplation. Four individuals, two men and two women, ostensibly share a meal together. However, their absorption in their phones is so intense that they neglect the chopsticks, engrossed in their digital worlds. This portrayal evokes a sense of dismay at the disconnection from genuine interaction—a disheartening dining experience, indeed.
> 
> The artist, with unequivocal intent, underscores the peril of being ensnared by mobile phone content, leading to a disinterest in direct communication, profoundly undermining interpersonal connections. Mutual respect and communication form the bedrock of human interaction. However, immersion in the virtual realm of smartphones culminates in a forfeiture of genuine connection, fostering social isolation.
> 
> Consequently, judicious use of smartphones is imperative—as a conduit for distant communication, a means to stay informed, and a source of leisure. When engaging in face-to-face dialogue, setting aside the device, actively participating in conversation, and validating others' emotions are pivotal in nurturing robust and meaningful relationships.

### 2017. Actions speak louder than words

![[英一看图写作-2017.png]]

- 首段：上图用鲜明的对比描述了一幅关于读书的引人深思的漫画。在左图中，有一个男子在充斥着图书的书架前懒散地躺在椅子上，说道“我有这么多书”。然而在右图，一个男子端坐在书桌前认真读书并做着读书笔记，说道“我争取今年读完20本书”。尽管同样是读书，两人的态度和行动却截然不同。

> As an old proverb reads,"Actions speak louder than words." But (as the figure above depicts/illustrats, a strongly contrasting cartoon about a **reading schedule** sparks/prompts a deep reflection on me)/(a strongly contrasting cartoon about reading schedules, as depicted by the figure above, causes me to reflect deeply). In the left picture, on a deck chair lazily lies a man and says “I have so many books”, where a bookshelf filled with books stands in front of him. However, in the right picture, **a man sits at the desk, reads dedicatedly, and takes notes, says ”I will try to finish 20 books this year.”** Although they both possess books, their attitudes and actions are quite distinct.

- 正文：上图可以与现实生活中的处理问题时的规划和执行力联系起来。事实上，生活中有很多人都像左图的男子一样，空有远大的抱负和丰厚的资源，却不肯脚踏实地开始行动，而是面对困难望而却步。这样的现象值得我们的注意，因为只有行动才能通向成功，只有实践才能将理想化为现实，空谈只会白白浪费时光。
- 在我看来，实践就是一条通往成功的道路。作为一名大学生，我拥有远大的理想，为了社会主义建设而奋斗终生，而这个理想的基础就是考研上岸。因此我做好了学习规划并坚持不懈地努力学习，就是为了实现这一目标。

> Such scenarios can be associated with **the plan and execution in dealing with real-world problems**. To be specific, there are people in life who, like the man on the left, have **lofty ambitions and abundant resources, but they are unwilling to take actions from the minor/petty matter and withdraw in the face of difficulties**. This phenomenon is of particular/particularly worth concerning for the reason that **only action can lead to success, only practice can turn idealization into reality, and talk can be merely a waste of time**.
> 
> From my perspective, **practice is the essential path to success**. As a college student, I have **a lofty ideal – a life-long struggle for socialist construction**. The foundation of this ideal is to pass the national examination entrance for postgraduates, so I make a detailed learning schedule and work hard to achieve it. 

- 结尾：总而言之，我们应该时刻牢记，空谈理想不可能实现，只有脚踏实地做好规划，从一点一滴开始做起，才是通向成功的唯一道路。

> In conclusion, we should always bear in mind that **idealization cannot be realized without striving**. **The only way to succeed is to make plans carefully and to take no pains to carry them out/spare no effort to achieve them.

>[!note] improved version
> An age-old adage asserts,"Actions speak louder than words." However, the visual narrative portrayed above presents a starkly contrasting tableau of two men's reading habits, inviting profound contemplation. The left image captures a man reclining lazily on a deck chair, declaring,"I have so many books," facing a towering bookshelf. In stark contrast, the right image showcases another man seated at a desk, engrossed in reading and meticulously jotting down notes, expressing,"I will strive to complete 20 books this year." Despite their shared possession of books, their contrasting attitudes and actions manifest vividly.
> 
> This visual allegory prompts reflections on the dichotomy between intention and action, resonating profoundly with navigating real-life challenges. Specifically, it draws attention to individuals, akin to the man on the left, brimming with aspirations and resources yet disinclined to act upon the minutiae or confront obstacles. This phenomenon warrants contemplation as action alone steers towards success; mere rhetoric risks squandering time. In my perspective, realizing lofty ideals necessitates action. As a college student, my aspiration to contribute to lifelong socialist construction hinges on passing the national postgraduate entrance examination. Hence, I meticulously devise learning schedules and exert diligent efforts to translate this ambition into reality.
> 
> In essence, the imperative truth undersocres that ideals materialize through diligent pursuit. Strategically crafting plans and unwaveringly pursuing them constitute the surest path to success.
> 
> Expanding upon the existing content, one could delve deeper into the psychology behind the inertia of inaction, exploring the root causes of reluctance to act despite possessing resources. Additionally, a paragraph elucidating the transformative power of consistent action in shaping character and molding perseverance could enrich the narrative.
