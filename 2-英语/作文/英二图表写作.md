### 2010 Mobilephone subscription
![[英二图表写作-2010-2.png]]

思路：
1. 描述图表：
    - 上述柱状图清晰地反映出发达国家和发展中国家的移动手机订阅数逐年增加的趋势和事实，但二者又有所不同。
    - 更准确地，从 2000 年到 2008 年，发达国家的移动手机订阅数缓慢地上升，大致从 0.5 billion 上升到 1 billion。与此同时，发展中国家的移动手机订阅数在 2000 年到 2002 年一直低于发达国家的订阅数，但在之后却快速上升，大致从 0.8 billion 跃升到 4 billion.
    - 这一现象背后的经济、社会等方面的因素值得深思。

2. 正文论证：
    - 上图可知，发达国家的移动手机订阅数上升缓慢，造成这一现象的原因可能是因为发达国家的人民本就富裕，移动手机更早期出现时大部分人就已购买，普及率本就较高。因此在这些国家移动手机市场属于存量市场，人们新购买的手机数就非常有限。并且发达国家的人口数也非常有限，相较于全球 60 多亿人，只有不到 10 亿人属于发达国家。
    - 与此相反，发展中国家人口众多，并且初期社会经济条件较差、移动手机普及率较低，因此随着近年社会经济的快速发展，人们越来越富裕、有足够的购买能力去购买移动手机。因此在这些国家移动手机市场属于增量市场，人们新购买的手机数非常多、增长非常快。
    - 因此，就社会经济和人口数量两方面原因考虑，可以解释为什么 2000 年到 2008 年间，发达国家移动手机订阅数增长缓慢，而发展中国家的订阅数增长迅速。

3. 结尾预测：
    - 总而言之，就现在而言，发展中国家和发达国家在 2008 年的订阅数合计达到 5 billion，已经接近世界人口的上限。
    - 因此可以大胆预测，这一订阅数的数据不会再猛烈增长，而是随着人口数的增长而持续、稳定地增长。

1. Describing the Chart:
    - The bar chart above vividly reflects the increasing trend but something distinct in mobile phone subscriptions in developed and developing countries from 2000 to 2008.
    - To be more precise, the number of mobile phone subscriptions in the developed countries showed/displayed a gradual increase/rise during this period, roughly from 0.5 billion to 1 billion.
    - In contrast, mobile phone subscriptions in developing countries, which were initially lower than those in developed countries, had surged rapidly/sharply/dramatically from around 0.8 billion in 2003 and thereafter/subsequently to approximately 4 billion since then.
    - The factors behind this phenomenon, spanning economics, society, demographics and more, warrant/demand profound consideration.

2. Main Discussion:
    - As observed in the chart, in developed countries, the gradual growth in mobile phone subscriptions can be attributed to their affluence. As soon as mobile phones hit the market, the people purchased them and, as a result, the proportion of mobile ownership was considerably high. Additionally, the population of developed countries is quite small compared to the global population of over 6 billion, which is less than 1 billion. As a consequence, the mobile market there became saturated, limiting new purchases.
    
    - Conversely, developing countries, with larger populations and initially lower mobile phone adoption rates due to original poor/impoverished/poverty socioeconomic conditions, experienced rapid growth in subscriptions as their economies improved in recent years. These countries represented a growth market, with a substantial increase in new subscriptions.
    
    - Thus, considering/taking into account both socioeconomic factors and population size, we can explain/interpret/illustrate why, from 2000 to 2008, mobile phone subscriptions in developed countries grew slowly while those in developing countries increased/expanded rapidly.

3. Conclusion and Prediction:
    - In conclusion, as of now, the total number of subscriptions for developing and developed countries reached 5 billion in 2008, which is close to the upper limit of the world population.
    - Therefore, it can be boldly/confidently predicted/anticipated that the data for this subscription number will not continue to grow violently, but will continue to increase steadily with the growth of population.

>[!note] refined version:
>The bar chart above vividly illustrates a discernible contrast in the trends of mobile phone subscriptions between developed and developing countries from 2000 to 2008. Specifically, mobile phone subscriptions in developed countries exhibited a gradual increase during this period, rising from approximately 0.5 billion to 1 billion. In contrast, mobile phone subscriptions in developing countries, initially lagging behind their developed counterparts, experienced a remarkable surge, escalating from around 0.8 billion in 2003 to an approximate 4 billion by the end of the period. This phenomenon necessitates a comprehensive analysis encompassing economic, societal, demographic, and other factors.
>
>As discerned from the chart, the gradual growth in mobile phone subscriptions in developed countries can be attributed to their affluence. With the introduction of mobile phones, their adoption rate was rapid, resulting in a substantial ownership percentage. Furthermore, the population of developed countries, which constitutes less than 1 billion of the global population of over 6 billion, led to market saturation, limiting further acquisitions. Conversely, developing countries, characterized by larger populations and initially lower mobile phone adoption rates due to initial socio-economic constraints, witnessed a rapid subscription increase as their economies progressed. These countries represented a burgeoning market, leading to a significant influx of new subscriptions. Thus, considering both socioeconomic variables and population size, we can comprehensively elucidate the disparity in mobile phone subscription growth between developed and developing countries from 2000 to 2008.
>
>In conclusion, as of 2008, the combined total of subscriptions in both developing and developed countries reached 5 billion, nearing the upper limit of the world's population. Consequently, it is reasonable to anticipate that the growth in subscription numbers will not continue at an exponential pace but will instead maintain a steady increase in line with population growth.

### 2012 Workers' sense of satisfication
![[英二图表写作-2012-2.png]]

思路：
1. 描述表格
    - 上述表格详细地展示了某公司三个不同年龄段的员工对工作的满意程度。
    - 准确地说，小于 40 岁的员工对工作满意的比例较低，仅有 16%，更多的是不确定是否满意，这一比例为 50% 。而 41~50 岁的员工几乎没有人对工作满意，相应地对工作感到不满意的占比高达 64%，是三个年龄段中最不满意工作的人群。最后，50 岁以上的员工有 40%对工作感到满意，50%不确定是否满意，仅有 10%——非常少的人对工作不满意。
    - 仔细地分析数据背后的原因，我们能够得到非常有价值的结论。

2. 解释原因
    - 图表中三个年龄段的人群对工作满意的占比截然不同的现象，我认为以下这些原因是非常有可能的。首先，40 岁以下的人群处于事业发展阶段，他们充满努力工作争取职位上升的动力，因此他们对工作既非满意也非不满意，而是倾向于努力奋斗实现工作事业上的目标。
    - 其次，41 岁到 50 岁的人群正承受着家庭、工作、年龄增长等诸多压力，但是由于能力所限又难以妥善地解决这些问题。他们对工作的不满意，实质上是对自己无力改变巨大压力的现状的不满。
    - 最后，50岁以上的人群到达了职业生涯的末期，这时他们的主要目标是安稳地工作生活直到退休，并且来自外界的压力也逐渐减小，因此他们对工作的满意程度增加。

3. 作出评论、建议
    - 因此，从各个年龄层的人群面临的压力挑战和他们的心态方面考虑，可以一定程度上解释表格中数据差异的原因。这也给公司的领导层以提示：可以集中精力缓解 41~50 岁人群的工作压力，可以很大程度上改善公司员工的精神面貌、保持更好的心态和工作效率。

Write in English:

The table above provides a detailed breakdown of job satisfaction among three distinct age groups of employees in a certain company/(of a given company). To be more precise, employees under the age of 40 exhibit a relatively low levels of job satisfaction rate, with only 16%/(16 percent) expressing satisfaction, while a significant/considerable/substantial 50%/(50 percent) are unsure about their job satisfaction. On the other hand, the age group between 41 and 50 demonstrates the lowest levels of job satisfaction, with a substantial 64%/(64 percent) reporting dissatisfaction. This group represents the largest number of dissatisfied people among the three age groups. In contrast, those aged 50 and older show/display/exhibit a more favorable trend, with 40%/(40 percent) expressing job satisfaction, 50%/(50 percent) remaining uncertain, and only a minimal/minuscule 10%/(10 percent) reporting job dissatisfaction. Carefully analyzing the reasons for the data, we were able to draw very valuable conclusions.

The noteworthy phenomenon of completely different job satisfaction proportions for the three age groups in the table is highly likely/probably due to the following reasons. First, individuals under the age of 40 tend to be in the early stages of their careers, driven by the motivation to achieve/accomplish professional growth. Consequently, their job satisfaction tends to hover between satisfaction and uncertainty as they strive towards their career goals. The 41-to-50 age group, on the other hand, is grappling with a wide range of pressures, including family, work-related challenges, and aging concerns. Their dissatisfaction largely/principally/predominantly stems from their perceived inability to address these multifaceted issues. In contrast, employees aged 50 and above have reached the twilight of their careers, where their primary focus is on achieving work-life balance and a gradual reduction in external pressures. This shift contributes to their higher job satisfaction.

Therefore, considering the diverse challenges faced/confronted/encountered by individuals across different age groups and their mentality/mindset, it can to some extent explain the reasons for the data differences in the table. This underscores the importance of addressing the work-related pressures experienced/suffered by those aged 41 to 50, which can lead to considerable improvements in the overall mental well-being and productivity of a company's workforce.

Write in English:

The provided pie chart vividly illustrates the distribution/allocation of expenses/costs among residents in a particular/specific/certain city during the Chinese New Year holiday. To break it down, costs for transportation, New Year gifts, gatherings and meals, and miscellaneous other items constitute 20%, 40%, 20% and 20%, respectively. Notably, the vast majority of expenditure is allocated/distributed to the purchase of New Year gifts.

Analyzing the financial/fiscal outflow unveils/discloses/reveals valuable insights for household budgeting and market resource allocation. Foremost, the significant 40% allocation for New Year gifts suggests/indicates a prevalent culture of exchanging meaningful presents during the holiday, which indicates people's desire and blessings to spend time with friends and relatives in harmony. This presents an opportunity for the government to stimulate people's consumption desire through innovative and memorable gift ideas and ensure the prosperous development of the market economy during the holiday. Additionally, both transportation and partying expenses stand at 20%, indicating substantial contributions to the development of related/associated industries. These highlight the need for the government to manage the associated pressures on transportation and catering resources while ensuring quality services. Last but not least, families experience considerable financial burdens during the holiday, necessitating prudent/rational planning to avoid financial strain.

In any case, it is hoped that society and families can scientifically and efficiently address the issue of expenditures on different items during the holiday, so as to stabilize socio-economic development and maintain the financial health of families.

### 2017 Nums of museums and visitors
![[英二图表写作-2017.png]]

1. 描述图表
    - 上述折线图描述了 2013-2015 年我国博物馆数量和参观人数的变化趋势。其中，博物馆数量从略高于 4000 家缓慢上升到接近 5000 家，而同一时期，总的参观人数则从 2013 年的 650 million 快速上升到 2015 年的接近 800 million。
    - 这幅图的两条曲线并非独立存在，而是有更深层次的联系。

2. 分析原因
    - 考虑到折线图中的博物馆数和参观人数的上升趋势，我们可以得出这些现象背后隐藏的原因。随着社会经济的发展，人们的物质生活越发富足，因此越来越多的人会在闲暇时追求精神文化上的培养与享受。而不论是观赏古代文物遗迹的博物馆，亦或是现代科技、艺术发展等方面的主题博物馆，成为人们选择丰富精神文化素养的首选，因此博物馆参观人数逐年增加。
    - 另一方面，博物馆数量与参观人数的增加相辅相成，二者关系密切，互相促进。博物馆数量越多，就越会吸引更多的游客参观，进一步地带动博物馆营业额增加，从而有博物馆的规模逐渐增大、博物馆的数量逐渐变多。

3. 预测趋势
    - 因此，参观博物馆人数和博物馆数量的增加，相当程度上表明了人们越来越重视精神文化的培养与富足。这是一种良好的社会风尚，值得越来越多的人学习、践行。另一方面，政府和有社会责任感的企业或个人也可以开办更多主题的博物馆，提供更加优惠、有精神文化价值的博物馆服务，培养精神文化更加全面的新时代社会主义人民。

Write in English:

The line chart above delineates the evolution of the number of museums and museum visitors in China from 2013 to 2015. Specifically, the number of museums experienced gradual growth from slightly over 4000 to nearly 5000, while the overall number of visitors surged from 650 million in 2013 to almost/practically 800 million in 2015 within the same timeframe. Notably, these two lines aren't isolated; a profound correlation exists between them.

Examining the ascending trajectories in the line chart allows/enables us to discern the underlying factors fueling these phenomena. As the social economy advances, people's material prosperity expands, prompting an increasing/rising number to seek/pursue spiritual and cultural enrichment during leisure. Museums, whether displaying/exhibiting ancient artifacts or focusing on contemporary technology and artistic advancements, have become the preferred/favored avenues for individuals to enhance their cultural literacy. As a consequence, the annual influx of museum visitors continues to rise/keeps rising. Simultaneously, the symbiotic relationship between the growth in the number of museums and the rise in visitors becomes evident/apparent. The more museums there are, the greater visitors are attached to, fostering an increase in museum turnover. This positive feedback loop leads to an expansion in the museum scale and a progressive rise in their overall numbers.

Therefore, the escalating trends in both museum visits and museum establishments signify a growing societal emphasis on spiritual and cultural development. This positive inclination is a noteworthy social trend, deserving further study and broader adoption. Moreover, it implies/suggests/hints at opportunities for government entities, socially responsible enterprises, or individuals to contribute to this cultural landscape. Establishing more theme-specific museums and delivering culturally valuable services can play a pivotal role in cultivating a well-rounded population with heightened spiritual and cultural awareness/consciousness in this new era. In conclusion, the surge in museum attendance and the proliferation of museums reflects a societal inclination towards the enrichment of spiritual culture. This trend not only deserves of study, but also presents avenues for stakeholders to contribute meaningfully to the cultural landscape.
